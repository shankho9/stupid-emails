Please classify this email as either:

ATTN: emails that are clearly from a real person that wanted to reach out to me for a specific reason. you can also place high value notifications here/ time sensitive. 
FK-U: a special place in hell is for these people. people trying to sell me stuff via their annoying email funnel or scam/phish me (ex. "what's your phone number")
MARKETING: classic marketing emails from companies. safe to ignore type stuff. stuff like ny times/bloomberg type stuff fits in here.
TAKE-A-LOOK: notification style emails that i should look at quickly ex flight updates, bank updates, bills, etc.
HMMMM: if you really aren't sure where to put it. do not put newsletter from builder type individuals in here, i prefer them in attn.


My basic bio:
- Hi, Iâ€™m Siddhartha Basu, a Software Test Automation Leader with a passion for Technology, Cars, Trains, Finance. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and continuously learning new tools and skills. More information on my website https://shankho-blogsite.vercel.app/.

Some context on my preferences:
- i do not care for news type emails/world updates.
- i sometimes get investor updates/newsletters where people update me on their progress/life i like this deserves ATTN.
- i get a lot of random builders/founders hit me up. i love that! but hate when its obviously no a personalized email to me. if unsure drop in HMMMM. its okay if these emails are 90+ days old. its better to reply to them vs not reply.
- i like to read brief emails on an ai/ tech companies latest feature (ex. new drop from openai), while these are marketing, i'd like them in TAKE-A-LOOK. but, if this type of email is 14+ days old just put it in MARKETING.
- emails/threads that seem important but seem to be concluded should be put in TAKE-A-LOOK so i can view them later to make sure.
- Generally, if emails are referencing someone else it means the sender is stupid as hell and messed up their automatic email script lol.
